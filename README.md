ronaldo is playing fifa against messi. suddenly, a contrivesial penalty is called by the ref, handing messi a free goal. ronaldo gets heated and they begin to argue. ronaldo then pulls the cords out, but the game stays on. confused, ronaldo and messi slowly creep up to the TV, but in an instant, ronaldo vanishes. jaws drop to the floor, and a second after messi disappears too. they find themselves stuck in the same game they were playing, with countless of other pitches and players nearby. with all of them facing the same objective. to score. who will be the first to five goals? who will escape?
